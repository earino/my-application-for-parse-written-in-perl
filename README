This is a little project to post to Parse's web services and
send them links to my resume, this git repository, and some
fun dumb MMA stuff.

I hope they take the time to look and talk to me.. I'm a pretty
interesting dude who has implemented a REST image management
web service that hosts 100 million digital assets and is used by
some HUGE companies :-)

Cheers!
